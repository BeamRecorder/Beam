# Changelog

User-facing changes to Beam are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added one-click Studio canvas screenshots with a three-second shortcut to open each capture in a new Screenshot editor window.
- Added reusable solid-color and saved-gradient controls for shapes and freehand drawings.
- Added multi-item copy, cut, and paste shortcuts with localized feedback in the Studio and Screenshot editors.
- Added direct clipboard-image paste into Screenshot compositions and Studio tracks, double-click crop, and on-canvas rotation handles for elements.

### Changed

- Property-panel delete footers now blend into the shared, symmetrical scroll shadow without an extra top border.
- Screenshot layers can now be reordered by dragging the layer row directly, without a separate drag handle.
- Screenshot editing now opens on Elements, and new annotation shapes start as unfilled outlined rectangles.
- Crop measurements and confirmation now stay together in a compact floating HUD outside the selected media.
- Copy and paste feedback in Screenshot and Studio now includes a visual thumbnail of the affected element.

### Fixed

- Fixed double-click crop so the primary screen recording can enter crop mode in Studio.
- Fixed Studio and Screenshot paste shortcuts so a freshly copied Beam element wins over a stale system-clipboard image.
- Fixed KDE/Wayland cursor metadata and pointer-motion capture for touchpads and absolute pointing devices.
- Fixed Windows cursor coordinates when display scaling is above 100%.
- Improved editor startup timeout diagnostics with copyable technical details.
- Fixed shape and drawing fill and border controls so each property updates the correct style, including immediately after creating a drawing.
- Fixed pasted Studio selections so every selected clip, caption layer, and zoom is recreated instead of only showing paste feedback.
- Corrected the Vietnamese folder reveal action to “Mở thư mục”.
